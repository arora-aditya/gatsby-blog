The recent death of YouTuber/Influencer [Corey La Barrie](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/12/us/ink-master-daniel-silva-murder-corey-la-barrie-trnd/index.html) on his 25th birthday has thrown a ripple in the online community, and although I have never watched any of his content, I have seen the impact it has had on some of the other people that I actively follow. This has definitely prompted me to think about how fragile our constructs of life really are.

This entire bubble we entrap ourselves in, the people we surround ourselves with, the places we go, the experiences we have, the memories we have captured in our heads, all of this is just one snap away.

I cannot even imagine losing a friend or a loved one to such craziness, and especially in times like these amidst the global pandemic, it has reduced the degrees of separation between us and losing the people we love. This is in no ways a parting letter to those near and dear to me, but rather a message of love and forgiveness.

So I'm taking this time to write out an open message to those that I consider friends and family, and to all those that consider me as one of their own. 

### To friends,
I want to thank you for all our moments of laughter and joy, for being there for when I was down, for roasting me to keep me grounded, for calling me out when I was spewing pure bullshit, and for just always being there whenever I needed anything at all. 

### To family, 
Thank you for always being the constant bedrock of unwavering support. I definitely know I rely on you guys more often than I like to admit, and you all definitely put up with all of my BS. You guys have always been there for me, and even though I like to think that I'm living and enjoying my independence, I do miss being the pampered kid at home with everything provided to me on a silver platter

### To those I wronged,
I'm sorry I hurt you, by my words or by my actions. I am sorry I did not do better. If there is ever a time I can right my wrong, please do let me know and I will jump on it ASAP. 

Lastly, if you ever think you wronged me, consider yourself forgiven. Life is too short to hold any grudges, and to not respect peoples requests for forgiveness.

To all the people I have ever crossed paths with, if there's ever anything I can do to make life a little bit easier for you, please do reach out. 

Life is too short to miss out those small moments, and to not tell the ones we care about that we do in fact appreciate and care about them despite the ups and downs of life.
