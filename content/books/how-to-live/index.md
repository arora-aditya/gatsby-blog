This was probably one of the most interesting books I've ever read. 

The succinctness of the book is what makes it so interesting. It's a collection of 27 different answers to the question of how to live your life. Each chapter disagrees with the rest. But in this case, they're all true, and it tickles to fantisize about each of them.

Consecutive chapters give conflicting advice, and yet the book is so short that you can read it in a single sitting.

Without wanting to spoil the book, I'll just say that Derek Sivers remains one of my most favorite authors. His books are also the ones I've gifted the most, and I suspect the trend will continue.
