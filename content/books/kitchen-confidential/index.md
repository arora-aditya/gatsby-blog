This has been one of the easiest books I have ever read. Anthony Bourdain's blunt yet honest description of his life, the food around it and the people around them is one that one can settle into and keep reading.

With a dedicated chapter to those who want to become chefs in their own right, I would recommend the honesty and the depth of the book to anyone who is interested in the culinary world.

It will also remind you to be mindful of the days you eat out and the food you order, the chef might be giving you his stale product to clear the walk-in freezer.

A couple of my favorite highlights from the book are below

-  Cooking is a craft, I like to think, and a good cook is a craftsman–not an artist. There’s nothing wrong with that: the great cathedrals of Europe were built by craftsmen–though not designed by them. Practicing your craft in expert fashion is noble, honorable and satisfying. And I’ll generally take a stand-up mercenary who takes pride in his professionalism over an artist any day. When I hear ‘artist’, I think of someone who doesn’t think it necessary to show up at work on time.


-  If you need instruction on how to handle a knife without lopping off a finger, I recommend Jacques Pépin’s La Technique. 

- Prior Preparation Prevents Poor Performance, as they say in the army–and I always, always want to be ready. 

- About his experience first time visiting Japan, Bourdain wrote: 
  > I sat by the window, head pounding, smoking and sipping, summoning the courage for another pass at a soba joint. There was no way, I told myself, that I was gonna eat my first Tokyo meal in Starbucks! Pinned under the wheels of that hypothetical Mister Softee truck, I would have something to regret. Muttering to myself, I charged out of Starbucks, found the narrowest, most uninviting-looking street, pushed aside the banner of the first soba shop I encountered, slid back the door and plopped myself down on a stool. When greeted, I simply pointed a thumb at the guy next to me and said, ‘Dozo. I’ll have what he’s having.’ Things worked out well. I was soon slurping happily away at a big, steaming bowl of noodles, pork, rice and pickles. This method of ordering would become my modus operandi over the following days and nights. I can tell you that I felt a lot better about myself after my breakfast. I spent a few hours at the restaurant before hailing a cab for Chiyoda-ku district. I had an engagement.
