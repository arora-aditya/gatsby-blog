description: "Celebrated NPR correspondent Nina Totenberg delivers an extraordinary memoir of her personal successes, struggles, and life-affirming relationships, including her beautiful friendship of nearly fifty years with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Four years before Nina Totenberg was hired at NPR, where she cemented her legacy as a prizewinning reporter, and nearly twenty-two years before Ruth Bader Ginsburg was appointed to the Supreme Court, Nina called Ruth. A reporter for The National Observer, Nina was curious about Ruth’s legal brief, asking the Supreme Court to do something revolutionary: declare a law that discriminated “on the basis of sex” to be unconstitutional. In a time when women were fired for becoming pregnant, often could not apply for credit cards or get a mortgage in their own names, Ruth patiently explained her argument. That call launched a remarkable, nearly fifty-year friendship. Dinners with Ruth is an extraordinary account of two women who paved the way for future generations by tearing down professional and legal barriers. It is also an intimate memoir of the power of friendships as women began to pry open career doors and transform the workplace. At the story’s heart is one, special relationship: Ruth and Nina saw each other not only through personal joys, but also illness, loss, and widowhood. During the devastating illness and eventual death of Nina’s first husband, Ruth drew her out of grief; twelve years later, Nina would reciprocate when Ruth’s beloved husband died. They shared not only a love of opera, but also of shopping, as they instinctively understood that clothes were armor for women who wanted to be taken seriously in a workplace dominated by men. During Ruth’s last year, they shared so many small dinners that Saturdays were “reserved for Ruth” in Nina’s house. Dinners with Ruth also weaves together compelling, personal portraits of other fascinating women and men from Nina’s life, including her cherished NPR colleagues Cokie Roberts and Linda Wertheimer; her beloved husbands; her friendships with multiple Supreme Court Justices, including Lewis Powell, William Brennan, and Antonin Scalia, and Nina’s own family—her father, the legendary violinist Roman Totenberg, and her “best friends,” her sisters. Inspiring and revelatory, Dinners with Ruth is a moving story of the joy and true meaning of friendship."

Nina Totenberg encapsulated the life of the legendary Ruth Bader Ginsburg (RBG) extremely well in 'Dinners with Ruth', including her journey in becoming a supreme court icon.

I gave a close friend this book as a gift before I had the chance to read it myself, so I set myself the goal to atleast finish it before they did, and I'm glad I did. The book so naturally surmised life's ups and downs, but with the totem of the importance of friendship, and the people you keep around. This book, as well as 'A promised land' by Barack Obama have genuinely opened my eyes to the genre of Memoirs and Biographies, and their very captivating nature given the retelling of real events.

Having known about the US supreme court as a beacon of justice that it was, and has currently faltered from, the book also provided an inside eye into the workings of the court, all the way upto the recent Dobbs ruling leak. It offered me fresh insight on the nature of friendships inside the highest court, even when opinions on both sides of the bench were starkly opposite. Scalia's friendship w/ RBG was probably one of the biggest surprises to me, given how idealogical different their opinions were. Nina's journalistic perspective, and the capacity to share the facts without the personal bias made it apparent to me that journalism is hard work. Especially in the era of fake news, AI generated spam articles covered with about a dozen popups, and social media being the main source of most people's news consumptions, its hard to not feel longing for a more simpler past where integrity and facts were held above all. Nina covers RBGs hold-out from resigining while Obama was still president, in the hopes that she would be able to empower then Democratic nominee Hilary Clinton to be the first woman to be able to appoint a Supreme court justice, but all those hopes being squandered away until her eventual demise. 

Would recommend the book to folks who have a decent interest in the workings of the highest court, and are interested in the persepective of friendships at the higest level.
