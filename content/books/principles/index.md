description: "In 'Principles,' investor and entrepreneur Ray Dalio shares his approach to life and management, which he believes anyone can use to make themselves more successful. Along the way of him founding and leading Bridgewater, Dalio discovered a set of unique principles that have led to Bridgewater’s exceptionally effective culture, which he describes as “an idea meritocracy that strives to achieve meaningful work and meaningful relationships through radical transparency.” It is these principles, and not anything special about Dalio—who grew up an ordinary kid in a middle-class Long Island neighborhood—that he believes are the reason behind his success."
