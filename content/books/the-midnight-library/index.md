Without spoiling the plot too much, this book might be the one that got me back into reading fiction again.

Matt Haig's take on the mental struggles each one of us go through everyday is so relatable, and easy to grasp, all while providing a fresh perspective on the concept of life and death.

The Midnight Library is a book that will make you think about your life, and the choices you've made, and the ones you still have to make. 

This section from one of the penultimate chapters of the book really resonated with me:

> We only need to be one person.
> We only need to feel one existence.
> We don’t have to do everything in order to be everything, because we are already infinite. While we are alive we always contain a future of multifarious possibility.
