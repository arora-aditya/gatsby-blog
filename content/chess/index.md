I realized one thing that I never shared on my blog, depsite its prominence in my day to day, is that I play chess, and not an insignificant amount. Atleast 10ish games a day, if not nearly double that on average.

My rating on Chess.com is around 1200, while on Lichess its around 1600. I mostly play Rapid [10-0] on Chess.com, but used to play a lot of blitz [3-2/5-0] as well.

It started out early pandemic, got a boost with the release of [Queen's Gambit on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80234304), and eventually led to me watching Twitch streamers play chess to get better, which I still do. 

And thus, to keep this as simple as possible, below are the 10 latest games I have played on [lichess](https://lichess.org), under the username [SwanJaguar](https://lichess.org/@/SwanJaguar) (autogenerated username ftw) dynamically updated every 10 minutes.
