# Blog V2

[![Build and Deploy](https://github.com/arora-aditya/gatsby-blog/actions/workflows/deploy-to-gh-pages.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/arora-aditya/gatsby-blog/actions/workflows/deploy-to-gh-pages.yml)

Re-write of my [original blog](https://github.com/arora-aditya/blogs) but this time in Gatsby!

The only reason for this shift is so that I am spared of writing HTML for each blog and can simply just write markdown!

## Dev documentation
1. `yarn install` before anything else
2. Other useful `yarn` commands
  - `yarn build`: build a copy of the blog in the `public/` directory complete w/ all assets
  - `yarn dev`: run a local copy of the blog, that refreshes on local updates
  - `yarn deploy`: deploy the blog to the github repo's `public` branch
