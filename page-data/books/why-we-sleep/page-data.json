That included cutting off most of my caffeine consumption, setting up a sleep schedule that sometimes was excrutiatingly interfering with my late night parties at University. It also involved getting up at the same time everyday, or atleast trying to continue the habit into the weekends after managing to keep it up during the week itself.

The same so called 9-5 has also been propagated in the workplace, despite it hampering the health of all those whose sleep schedules do not align.
